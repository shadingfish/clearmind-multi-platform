                Our app's tracker feature is designed to support your goal
                achievement. Utilizing the information gathered earlier, we've
                established a weekly goal spanning 7 days for you. It's
                essential to update your progress daily and click on the
                <Text fontWeight={"bold"}> self-check-in button</Text> once
                you've completed your daily goal. This allows you to record your
                progress and difficult emotions, as well as reflect on any
                cognitive strategies youâ€™ve used to overcome procrastination.
